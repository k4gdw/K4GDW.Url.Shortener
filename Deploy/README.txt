Thank you for trying out the K4GDW URL Shortener.

To install, simply unzip the contents of this zip file into a
folder of your choice, then create a shortcut to it on your
desktop or wherever else you want it.

To use it, simply paste the long URL you wish shortened into the
text box and click the button for the URL shortening service you
wish to use.  The app currently supports bit.ly and tinyurl.com.
The shortened URL will be automatically copied into your windows
clipboard.

Versions:

1.0 -		Initial release.

1.1 -		Added URL validation to make sure the URL is valid before
			calling the bit.ly or tinyurl.com api.

1.1.1 -	Fixed a bug in the URL validation function that caused some
			URLs to get http:// inserted when it shouldn't.
				
1.2.0 -	This is a minor change that should preempt further bugs in the
			URL validation.  Instead of trying to fix an invalid URL, it now
			leaves the buttons disabled until a valid URL is entered.
			
2.0.0	-	Added support for the is.gd service.
